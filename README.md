# RobotStreamer
RobotStreamer is a low latency livestreaming platform. Stream from your desktop or robot straight to RobotStreamer.com.

Broadcasters make the rules for their channels. Unlike most platforms, RobotStreamer is open to just about any content. Just maintain basic ethical decency, keep it legal, and keep it entertaining. For language, it's up to the broadcaster to decide how they want to moderate if at all.

One of our biggest specialties is the fact you can livestream straight from a Robot while maintaining low latency, people across the website can control your bot and you can montenize your bot's features!

Funbits is a way to montenize your streams allowing your viewers to communicate to you through TTS (Text to Speech), or interact with your robot.
